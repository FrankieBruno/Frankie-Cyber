# âš¡ SOC Automation Project

**Objective:** Automate detection, response, and integrity monitoring tasks to reduce manual workload in a SOC environment.  

**Highlights:**  
- Automated file integrity monitoring with `md5sum` hashes.  
- Implemented least-privilege and permissions hardening (`chmod`).  
- Simulated ransomware containment using isolation strategy.  
- Documented full incident response lifecycle: Preparation â†’ Detection â†’ Containment â†’ Eradication â†’ Recovery â†’ Lessons Learned.  

**Tools Used:**  
- Shuffle SOAR (workflow automation concept)  
- Linux command-line utilities  
- CrowdStrike (simulated for IR lifecycle)  
- Autopsy (digital forensics)  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Security automation & orchestration  
- Incident response planning  
- Digital forensics  
- Case management workflows (TheHive alignment)
