# ðŸ”´ Penetration Testing Report

**Objective:** Assess the security posture of client systems by identifying, exploiting, and escalating vulnerabilities.  

**Key Findings:**  
1. Weak web application input handling (command injection â†’ RCE).  
2. Poor SSH key management (unprotected private keys).  
3. Weak password hashing (cracked via John the Ripper).  
4. Misconfigured Windows SMB service (enabled lateral movement).  

**Tools Used:**  
- Nmap (scanning)  
- Linux command line (privilege escalation & pivoting)  
- John the Ripper (password cracking)  
- Metasploit (Windows exploitation)  
- SSH client (lateral movement)  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Vulnerability scanning & exploitation  
- Credential harvesting  
- Pivoting & lateral movement  
- Red Team reporting
